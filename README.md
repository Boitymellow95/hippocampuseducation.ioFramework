patterns and predictive model of the intelligent tutor sytem 

 Hippocampus is an intelliegent tutoring  system for e-learning in digital STEM Subjects. The hippo  system provides learning materials through specialized facebook messager - for the students, and asks them to solve various problems with different levels of difficulty.

The hippocapus dataset was collected from University of wits by using Hipposysyem, 30 first-year engineering students are required to use Hippo to learn Chemistry which consists of 3 sessions /pallets.
All the log data of students using Hippo system was collected during the process of learning: Questions, time, Date,Corrrect questions ,explanation rates. At the end of each session, students needed to finish an assignment, and the grade of the assignment was recorded in the intermediate grade dataset.

The main purpose of our project is to build a model that can predict whether a student can pass the final exam based on their logs data of chemistry sessions recorded on the hippo system. By using this model, the instructors can notify those who-may-fail-at-final to help them re-catching the learning schedule
